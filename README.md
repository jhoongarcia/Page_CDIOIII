## Project Description
This project was carried out with an emphasis on solving a fundamental need on the part of farmers, due to lack of information, 
this gives to ignore the price of their product causing some people to take advantage of this confusion thinking about their own good, 
as a consequence generating a significant imbalance in the price of the product therefore a web structure was implemented that comes 
with certain characteristics of a social network where they can communicate both farmers and different traders along the value chain of this product.
